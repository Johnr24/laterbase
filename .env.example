# Comma-separated list of database names on the primary Laterbase server to back up
# Required by the backup-agent for pg_dump (e.g., db1,db2,another_db)

# Optional: Port and User for primary connection if not default (5432, postgres)
# PRIMARY_PORT=5432

# These override the defaults set in docker-compose.yml for the standby service
# POSTGRES_USER=postgres
# POSTGRES_DB=laterbase_standby_db
# PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata

# --- Backup Agent & Duplicati Configuration ---

# Path on the host machine where local .sql.gz backups are stored by backup.sh
# This directory is mounted into the backup-agent container as /backups (writeable)
# and into the duplicati container as /backups (read-only).
LOCAL_BACKUP_PATH=./backups

# Number of days to keep local .sql.gz backups in the LOCAL_BACKUP_PATH volume.
# This cleanup is performed by backup.sh (run by the scheduler).
# Duplicati manages its own remote retention based on its job settings.
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=7

# --- Duplicati Service Configuration ---
# Timezone for the Duplicati container (e.g., Europe/London, America/New_York, Etc/UTC)
# See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
TZ=Etc/UTC

# Optional: Set a password for the Duplicati Web UI. Uncomment and set the value.
# DUPLICATI_WEBSERVICE_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

# --- Duplicati Job Setup (Done via Web UI at http://localhost:8200) ---
# - General: Give your backup job a name. Encryption is recommended.
# - Destination: Choose your storage provider (e.g., Google Drive, S3, B2) and configure credentials/bucket details.
# - Source Data: Select the '/backups' folder inside the container.
# - Schedule: Set how often Duplicati should check for new files and upload them (e.g., "Run daily at 3:00 AM").
#             Note: backup.sh creates new .sql.gz files hourly (via Ofelia). Duplicati will upload any new files found since its last run.
# - Options: Configure remote retention (e.g., "Keep backups for 30 Days"). This controls how long backups are kept *at the destination*.
